Calling back to John Picozzi\u2019s presentation at DrupalCon 2022 and his article on [Opensource.com,](https://opensource.com/article/22/8/non-code-contribution-powers-open-source) we look at how his views on contributions align with ours at [Jan](https://jan.ai)\\n\\n![how to contribute opensource non-code](./assets/01-how-to-contribute-to-open-source-non-code.png)\\n\\n[https://jan.ai/about/#open-source](https://jan.ai/about/#open-source)\\n\\n#### Broadening the Definition of Contribution - how it benefits everyone\\n\\nContribution in open source isn\u2019t just about coding, and Picozzi nails it with this point.\\n\\nAt Jan, we\u2019re all about embracing different skills\u200a\u2014\u200abecause that\u2019s what fuels innovation and growth.\\n\\n> Contribution? It\u2019s when you take time to push forward ideas, vision, and awareness. Here are some solid ideas and how they\u2019ve been executed before.\\n\\n#### Documentation - One Pillar of Contribution\\n\\nRemember those ancient storytellers and their crucial role in history? That\u2019s what modern documentation does in tech. It\u2019s the backbone of knowledge transfer. Without it, we\u2019d be lost in translating what our products are all about.\\n\\n![](./assets/01-credit-janhq-repo.png)credit- Janhq/jan repo\\n\\n#### Writing and Editing\\n\\nGot a knack for words? Awesome! Making complex stuff easy and friendly is a real game-changer. Search around and see if your favourite open-source project has a tone of voice guide or style guide. (We\u2019re currently making one!)\\n\\n#### Translating\\n\\nSpeak another language? You could jump in and help translate documents. You\u2019ll be flinging open doors for heaps of non-native language speakers and will scale awareness and adoption in a pretty big way.\\n\\n#### Creating Tutorials and Guides\\n\\nProjects thrive on collective knowledge being shared. Maybe your way of contributing is helping newbies find their feet by showcasing how you use the product?\\n\\n### Spreading the Word- Storytelling and \u2018Marketing\\n\\nIn the OS world, marketing is more about storytelling and community building than selling.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what can make an impact that isn\u2019t code-\\n\\n- Social media, blogs, forums- When the folks running open source projects are knee-deep in code, spreading the word might slip their minds. Your tweets, blogs, and comments? They\u2019re more impactful than you think.\\n\\n* Content creation -If you\u2019re into making videos or infographics, your skills can tell the project\u2019s story in ways that really stick.\\n\\n#### Event Planning and Meetups\\n\\nHosting online meetups or webinars? It\u2019s a great way to share knowledge, connect people, and gather feedback as to how people are connecting with the project.\\n\\n### Contributing via \u2018Dot Connecting\u2019\\n\\nKnow people who might be interested or can chip in? Bringing in new energy and ideas is what keeps open source buzzing. Spot an opportunity for a partnership? Go for it!\\n\\nLinking up with educational bodies, non-profits, or businesses can work wonders depending on the projects end goals.\\n\\n### Why People Contribute to Open Source\\n\\nAs Picozzi points out, it\u2019s all about embracing every kind of skill. At Jan, we celebrate each team member\u2019s unique contributions.\\n\\nIt\u2019s about being part of something bigger, honing new skills, and feeling that sense of belonging.\\n\\n#### What the Company/Project Gets Out of It\\n\\nBy valuing non-code contributions, open-source projects, and companies tap into a broader skill set, leading to more well-rounded development and problem-solving. A diverse community is key to Jan\u2019s success, just like Picozzi emphasizes.\\n\\n### Challenges in Non-Code Contributing\\n\\nImposter syndrome? We get it, and we\u2019re tackling it by creating a welcoming space for all contributions. Jan\u2019s big on balancing work, life, and contribution\u200a\u2014\u200aintegrating it into our culture without overwhelming the team.\\n\\n#### How Do You Start Contributing to OpenSource?\\n\\nJust like Nike\u2019s \u201cjust do it\u201d, we\u2019re all about making it easy for our team to dive into areas they\u2019re passionate about. Here\u2019s our [labelled issues for contributors](https://github.com/janhq/jan/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\\n\\n#### Here\u2019s the [Jan readme](https://github.com/janhq/jan?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)\\n\\n#### [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/JPcNRaJyzJ)"}]}')}}]);
